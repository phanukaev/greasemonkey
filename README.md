## Youtube Music Playlist Extractor

[Click to Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phanukaev/greasemonkey/refs/heads/main/yt_music_playlist.user.js)

Adds a button to any youtube music playlist page which allows the user
to download the playlist in JSON format. Each playlist entry is an
object with properties `title`, `artist`, `album`, and `url` which all
contain the obvious values.
